 * Configuration file for the web application.

 * Things in the config file include settings that CHANGE based on the deployment of the web application. This convention makes it easy to 
 * configure the deployment by changing one file instead of having to edit code.
 * 
 * We recommend having a webapp.conf.dev and a webapp.conf.production in your RCS, and simply changing the filename of the one you want to
 * use to webapp.conf on each machine.
 *
 * Configurable elements that don't change based on deployment are typically done via the WFWebApplication and its delegate.
