AUTOWEB is a powerful PHOCOA module.

AUTOWEB is a dynamic database editor for Propel-based databases.

Simple configure the settings in autoweb.config and access the autoweb module on your server (http://your-server.com/webapp/autoweb usually).

This will allow you to browse your database immediately.

AUTOWEB dynamically reads your Propel database metadata and builds a web application on-the-fly to provide access to the records.

Presently, AUTOWEB provides read-only browsing of data. The data is paginated.

In the future, we will be adding capabilities for AUTOWEB to search, edit, create, and delete records.

We are considering architectural strategies at this time. One model is to base it on DirectToWeb from WebObjects.

This is just in the conceptual phase now, as we want to carefully consider the various architectures for creating applications in this way.

Please note that AUTOWEB is a separate project from the skeleton application generation capabilites also being planned. The skeleton app code gen scripts will create the skeleton of a complete database admin for your Propel tables. Once the skeleton is created, that's it for this process. The rest is just editing the code. Skeleton code gen is just a jump-start to building your app, and is not intended to be a complete solution.

AUTOWEB, on the other hand, with appropriate configuraiton, could be a useable web front end.
